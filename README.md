# RESTful API with ASP.NET Core 8

Welcome to the documentation for our RESTful API built using ASP.NET Core 8. This project adheres to the principles of the REST (Representational State Transfer) architectural style, ensuring compliance with all required constraints and sub-constraints for creating a true RESTful web service.

## Overview

This API is built with ASP.NET Core 8, designed to be a scalable, stateless, and high-performance service following RESTful principles. Below, we detail how our implementation meets the key REST constraints.

## RESTful Constraints

### 1. **Statelessness**

Each request from a client to the server must contain all the information the server needs to fulfill the request. The server does not store any client context between requests.

- **Implementation**: ASP.NET Core 8 middleware and controllers ensure that each request is stateless. Authentication and authorization are handled through tokens (e.g., JWT) included in each request, not through server-side sessions.

### 2. **Client-Server Architecture**

The client and server are distinct entities, allowing them to evolve independently. This separation supports scalability and flexibility.

- **Implementation**: The API is designed to be consumed by various clients, including web applications and mobile apps. The server-side code is decoupled from client-side implementations, enabling independent development and scaling.

### 3. **Uniform Interface**

A uniform interface simplifies interactions between clients and servers, improving system scalability. This includes:
   - **Resource Identification**: Resources are identified by URIs.
   - **Resource Manipulation**: Resources are manipulated using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
   - **Self-Descriptive Messages**: Requests and responses include sufficient metadata.
   - **Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)**: Responses include links to related resources.

- **Implementation**:
  - **Resource Identification**: URIs follow REST conventions (e.g., `/api/users/{id}`).
  - **Standard Methods**: Use of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) is implemented in ASP.NET Core controllers.
  - **Self-Descriptive Messages**: Metadata is provided through response headers and body content.
  - **HATEOAS**: Implemented using ASP.NET Core’s support for generating links within responses.

### 4. **Layered System**

The API architecture includes multiple layers to handle different concerns, such as client interaction, business logic, and data access.

- **Implementation**: The API follows a layered architecture:
  - **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses.
  - **Services**: Contain business logic.
  - **Repositories**: Manage data access and persistence.
  - **Middlewares**: Handle cross-cutting concerns like logging and exception handling.

### 5. **Cacheability**

Responses must explicitly indicate whether they are cacheable to improve performance by reducing redundant requests.

- **Implementation**: The API uses ASP.NET Core’s built-in caching mechanisms. Appropriate HTTP caching headers (e.g., `Cache-Control`, `ETag`) are set in responses to control caching behavior.

### 6. **Code on Demand (Optional)**

Servers can extend client functionality by transferring executable code. This constraint is optional and not always implemented.

- **Implementation**: The API does not use code on demand. It focuses on providing resources and interactions through standard HTTP methods.

## Getting Started
To get started with this API, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
